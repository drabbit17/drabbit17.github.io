I am a knowledge worker with a few years of experience working with data. I can write decent enough code to be deployed, although I fantasize with the idea that I write clean code.

I also like climbing and hanging out on mountains, a lot. Unfortunately it's harder for me to fantasize with the idea that I am a good climber. I like mountains (and saving money) so much that I also made a hiking/climbing/mountaineering price comparison website called [Smart Hiker](https://smarthiker.co.uk/).

I am currently working at [Migacore](https://migacore.com/). I have been working for a while at [iwoca](https://www.iwoca.co.uk/) and interned at P&G and at the European Commission. I have both a bachelor and a master of science in economics (even though I mostly attended stats courses) from Bocconi University. I really liked R but now I write mostly in python, also in english sometimes, and probably less successfully.

I lived in a bunch of places, including Australia. I now live in London (UK), where after 5 years I still enjoy making jokes with brits about the weather.
