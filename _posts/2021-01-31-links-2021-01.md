excerpt: Interesting readings of the month

[Why books don’t work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) by Andy Matuschak, mind-blowing article of the month. It claims that the most common mediums used in education (ie books, lectures) take a form that is not aligned with how we best learn, according to cognitive science. Most books and lectures assume that the learning process happens by transmission, by simply being exposed to knowledge. While in order to learn it is necessary to actively think about the material, practice with and create connections. Given that by replacing books and lectures with a medium with a form that makes the thinking/practicing happen naturally it would become much easier to make people learn

[Augmenting Long term memory](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) by Michael Nielsen. Really nice article describing why it makes sense to use spaced repetition, specifically through Anki, to solidify your learnings in memory. The article is very thorough and provides a lot of real (and personal) examples of how to use the Anki system

[Regrets of the dying](https://bronnieware.com/blog/regrets-of-the-dying/). The article has been written by a palliative care worker. By having been exposed for a long time to the last days of many patients she has been able to summarise their main last regrets. From time to time it’s good to read how the awareness that the end is approaching makes people value how they spent their life. “When breath becomes air” is a book I really appreciated on this topic

I really enjoyed two pieces from Morgan Housel, fund manager at Collaborative Fund, and former Motley Fool columnist. [The first one](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/sure/) contains a few nice bits of wisdom. It won’t change your life but it may make you ponder on some aspects of it. [The second one](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/crazy/) is about how dynamics susceptible to feedback loops may very quickly evolve in unexpected directions. To clarify this idea he describes how a decrease in the elephant population leads to stronger tusk demand, which leads to a further decrease in the population and even stronger demand, and so on until extinction. He claims that a similar feedback loop applied to decaying brands (Sears) and growing trends (GameStop).
